# Real-Time-Alerting-Pipeline-Prometheus-to-Slack-via-Alertmanager

This project implements an automated monitoring and notification system where Prometheus identifies and sends alerts to Alertmanager, which processes them and forwards notifications to a designated Slack channel. The setup ensures efficient incident detection and response through seamless integration between tools.
